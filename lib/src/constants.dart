      """It causes direct grain yield loss by replacing grains with toxic alkaloid-containing sclerolia, making the produce unfit tor consumption.""",
  "Symptoms":
      """The ergot causing fungus infects the florets and develops in the ovaries, producing initially copious creamy, pink, or red colored sweet sticky liquid called honey dew.""",
  "Causal Fungus": """Claviceps fusiformis""",
  "Control": """A. Cultural control
Deep ploughing soon after harvest helps bury sclerotia in a soil at a depth which prevents their germination, thus reducing primary inoculum. Separate infested seed from normal seed by soaking in 10% salt solution. Floating light weight infested seeds are separated from normal grain which sinks to the bottom. In India, two perennial grass weeds Cenchrus ciliaris and Panicum antidotale were found to harbor the pearl millet ergot fungus.
Eradicating these two weeds from around pearl millet fields during early May / June might help reduce the inoculum.


B. Host â€“plant Resistance
Use of resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective method for the control of Ergot Disease. Four open pollinated varieties, WC-C75, ICMS 7703, ICTP 8203, and ICMV 155 released in India are resistant to Ergot Disease.
